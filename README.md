# ReAção Project

Project exploring the creation of artistic applications that interact with the user's emotion.

The project consists of two parts, the first in implementing a server to detect the emotions of a person in front of a webcam, and the second in creating experiments using the Unity game engine.

## Server
The server can be found in the "Server" folder, and needs the [emonet](https://github.com/face-analysis/emonet) emotion detection model to work.

## Unity project
The Unity project with the experiments is in the "ReAcao" folder, and contains two experiments with same scene name:

- Colors: inspired by Bridget's paintings, the colors on the screen are changed to reflect the detected emotional state.
- Interrogatory (under progress): it puts the player in the role of an accused in an interrogation, where their emotions can determine the outcome.
